# What Is This?
I play Dance Dance Revolution. In this game, you use speed mods to increase the arrow scroll speed. People have preferences for how fast the arrows should scroll, but whoops! They don't show you the actual speed.

# How To Use
This app allows you to set your speed preference and enter a song BPM. The app uses a complex AI algorithm (multiplication) to calculate the best speed mod setting.

# App???
I ported this to an APK at some point via phonegap and maybe I'll do it again some day.
